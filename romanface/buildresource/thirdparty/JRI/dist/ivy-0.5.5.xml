			JRI is a Java/R Interface, which allows to run R inside Java applications 
			as a single thread. Basically it loads R dynamic library into Java and 
			provides a Java API to R functionality. It supports both simple calls to 
			R functions and a full running REPL. 
		
			Fetched from the
			<a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">rJava</a>
			project because this contains later versions of JRI than the 
			<a href="http://www.rforge.net/JRI/">JRI homepage</a>.
