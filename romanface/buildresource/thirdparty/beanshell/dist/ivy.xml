			BeanShell is a small, free,	embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting
			language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes
			standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences
			such as	loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl
			and	JavaScript.
